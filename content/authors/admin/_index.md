I am Xu Huang, an incoming MPhil student at Peking University, advised by Prof. Daquan Zhou. My research interests lie in multimodal unified models, video generation, and world models.
Currently, I am a Research Intern at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI), contributing to Emu3.5 Unified multimodal model. 
Previously, I worked at Tencent on 3D scene layout generation and at Peking University on efficient pretraining and inference of large language models.
My background in competitive programming includes awards such as the ACM-ICPC Gold Medal, CCPC Gold Medal, and NOI Silver Medal.
